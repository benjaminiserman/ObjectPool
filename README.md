# ObjectPool
A generic ObjectPool for C#

This class is just a super simple generic ObjectPool to aid in memory management.
It's mostly helpful for dealing with objects that are being created and discarded frequently when they could just be reused.
It's actually based on the implementation I use in my super secret personal project, so you know it's good!
